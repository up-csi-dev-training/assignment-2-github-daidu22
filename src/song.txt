Too Little, Too Late
by Laufey

Verse 1
The whole town is talking 'bout how you've fallen in love
I read in the papers, he's someone that girls dream about
Some kind of ruler on top of a kingdom
I'm just a jester, I'll never be him

Pre-Chorus
Last night, you called to me
It almost killed me

Chorus
To hear you scream my name
Your smile still kills the same
I almost turned around
You chased me to the ground
You asked me how I've been, but how do I begin
To tell you I should've chased you 'cross every single state
I lay down my sword for fate
'Cause it's too little, way too late

Verse 2
I didn't need the reminder of things I've done wrong
Of promises broken, fragility hidden in song
Guess that we're soulmates in different lifetimes
What if you leave him, throw me a lifeline

Pre-Chorus
I know that you're happy
But it just killed me

Chorus
To hear you scream my name
A clear fucking X-ray of if I'd stuck around
I swear to God, I almost drowned
You asked me how I've been, but how could I begin
To tell you I should've chased you
I should be who you're engaged to

Bridge
Lost my fight with fate
A tug-of-war of leave and stay
I give in, I abdicate
I lay my sword down anyway
I'll see you at Heaven's gate
'Cause it's too little, way too late

Outro
I'll toast outside your wedding day
Whisper vows, I'll never say to you
'Cause it's too little, all too late
