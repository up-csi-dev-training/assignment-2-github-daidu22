Too Little, Too Late
by Laufey

Verse 1
The whole town is talking 'bout how you've fallen in love
I read in the papers, he's someone that girls dream about
Some kind of ruler on top of a kingdom
I'm just a jester, I'll never be him

Pre-Chorus
Last night, you called to me ☎️
It almost killed me 💔

Chorus
To hear you scream my name 💭
Your smile still kills the same 😊
I almost turned around 🔁
You chased me to the ground 🏃‍♂️💨
You asked me how I've been, but how do I begin 🤔
To tell you I should've chased you 'cross every single state 🗺️
I lay down my sword for fate ⚔️
'Cause it's too little, way too late ⏰

Verse 2
I didn't need the reminder of things I've done wrong
Of promises broken, fragility hidden in song
Guess that we're soulmates in different lifetimes
What if you leave him, throw me a lifeline

Pre-Chorus
I know that you're happy 😊
But it just killed me 💔

Chorus
To hear you scream my name 💭
A clear fucking X-ray of if I'd stuck around 💔‍🩹
I swear to God, I almost drowned 🌊
You asked me how I've been, but how could I begin 🤷‍♂️
To tell you I should've chased you 🏃‍♂️💨
I should be who you're engaged to 💍

Bridge
Lost my fight with fate ⚖️
A tug-of-war of leave and stay 👨🧵👨
I give in, I abdicate 👋
I lay my sword down anyway ⚔️
I'll see you at Heaven's gate 😇
'Cause it's too little, way too late ⏰

Outro
I'll toast outside your wedding day 🥂
Whisper vows, I'll never say to you 💭
'Cause it's too little, all too late ⏳
